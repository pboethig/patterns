# patterns
some daily php programmingpatterns 

strategypattern:
- change the tools to process data during runtime depending on needed strategy

adapterpattern
- dont react on changes in webservice directly in your clientcode. Put an adapter inbetween and react there
  so the clientcode will never change, what is good
