# patterns
some daily php programmingpatterns 

strategypattern:
- change the tools to process data during runtime depending on needed strategy

adapterpattern:
- dont react on changes in webservice directly in your clientcode. Put an adapter inbetween and react there
  so the clientcode will never change, what is good

fassadepattern:
- hide complex api calls and logic behind a simply well structured fassade. So you can reduce complexity, increese performance in webservice apis an
  make developers feel lucky to have a fassade.
